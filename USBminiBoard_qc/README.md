# Boss MS-3 Arduino library
Use this library to connect to, query and control the Boss MS-3 and compatible devices.

All issues, feature requests, praise and bug reports should be made at the GitHub project at https://github.com/MrHaroldA/MS3.

## Development state
The library is close to being finished, as it seems to be pretty stable for controlling the MS-3. There are some issues receiving data from the MS-3, but they seem to be related to the USB Host Shield library and/or the USB Midi implementation in that library.

## Dependencies
You will need a USB Host Shield compatible with the Arduino of your choice and the USB_Host_Shield_2.0 library.

* https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0

## Getting started
If you have an Arduino and USB shield available, check out one of the examples provided with this library. If you need help connecting to your MS-3 you may open a question by clicking the 'New issue' button. No; I won't write your application for you, but I might give you some pointers on how to get started. 

I do expect you to have a basic knowledge of the Arduino and C/C++ and you should have checked out both the examples of this library, as well as the examples for the USB Host Shield.
