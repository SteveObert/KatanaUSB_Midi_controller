# Teensy MIDI controller for Katana 100
## Warning Beta code 

In this version of the sketch the LCD and LEDs are updated from Katana's USB MIDI and some CC and PC messages can be sent from an external MIDI device to the Teensy via the serial MIDI IN port.

Gumtown from the Vguitar forum deserves recognition for his contributions writng the code that parses incoming data and updates the LCD and LEDs.
