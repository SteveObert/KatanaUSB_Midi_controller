# This is the Boss MS-3 Arduino library modified to work with the Boss Katana amp.

**The owner of the MS3 library has worked to update his library for the Katana. I need to go back through my code and make some adjustments to use his version of the library. In the mean time please use the version above.


Original library found here: https://github.com/MrHaroldA/MS3
